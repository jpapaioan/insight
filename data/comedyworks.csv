AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.
AJ is an effective and engaging storyteller with a rhythm that quickly pulls you into his world. You'll laugh until you leave and then later you'll laugh again.

Dan began performing stand-up comedy several years ago in, believe it or not, law school. After graduation he decided to devote himself to stand-up full time. Comedy, he discovered, was his true passion. Besides, his grades were bad and nobody would hire him. 

Dan's charming combination of self-deprecation and outright grouchiness has had audiences howling from coast to coast and has earned him four appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Tonight Show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, his own ""Comedy Central Presents..."" Special and a starring run on NBC's America's Got Talent.

With forty-four Letterman appearances under his belt, more than any other comic, (not to mention a handful of Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Politically Incorrect gigs) Jake is no stranger to late night television. His late night appearances gave Jake the exposure he needed to land his very own HBO comedy special, This’ll Take About An Hour. Jake received incredible reviews, strong ratings, and a Cable Ace Award nomination for Best Writing in an Entertainment Special. People Magazine rated the special as one of the “ten best television shows of the year,” and TV Guide named it one of the “50 Funniest Moments of TV.”

Jake is also making his mark on the feature world. Jake appeared on the big screen next to Bruce Willis in the Alan Rudolph film Breakfast of Champions. Jake first worked with Rudolph on the film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, in which he co-starred in a cast that included Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell Scott.

Jake’s bizarre take on life and his uniquely intelligent style have made him a regular at comedy clubs all over the country and a former host of Comedy Central’s Two Drink Minimum.

Keenen Ivory Wayans, a visionary trailblazer in comedy and professional springboard for his siblings, helped change what America finds funny.

As a director, writer and producer, Wayans is responsible for creating the groundbreaking sketch comedy TV show In Living Color and the films I’m Gonna Git You Sucka, White Chicks and the first two installments of the Scary Movie franchise. The 55-year old eldest brother of Damon, Kim, Marlon and Sean is now coming back to his comedy roots in stand-up making a stop for a rare club performance in Denver this October.

Wayans spends more time writing and directing big Hollywood movies than he does working the stage. He co-wrote Eddie Murphy: Raw and briefly hosted his own show called The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show. Recently, Wayans has returned back on the small screen as a guest actor on TV Land’s sitcom Happily Divorced, which stars Tichina Arnold.

Wayans has never been a one-liner kind of guy, but more of a storyteller. In the words of Wayans himself,  “I’m a disciple of [Richard] Pryor and [George] Carlin and that school of comedy — much more of a storyteller, much more personal stuff, just talking about my life.”

Lewis Black at Paramount Theatre
Comedy Works Entertainment Presents Lewis Black The Joke’s On Us Tour

Lewis Black, Grammy Award-winning, stand-up comedian, is one of the most prolific and popular performers working today. He executes a brilliant trifecta as a stand-up comedian, actor and author. Receiving critical acclaim, he performs more than 200 nights annually, to sold-out audiences throughout Europe, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. He is one of a few performers to sell out multiple renowned theaters, including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Brooks Atkinson Theatre, New York City Center, the Main Stage at the Mirage in Las Vegas and most recently, a sold-out Broadway run at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City. 

His live performances provide a cathartic release of anger and disillusionment for his audience. He is a passionate performer who is a more pissed-off optimist than a mean-spirited curmudgeon. Lewis is the rare comic who can cause an audience to laugh themselves into incontinence while making compelling points about the absurdity of our world.

Lewis Black came into national prominence with his appearances on The Daily Show in 1996. Those appearances on The Daily Show led to comedy specials on HBO, Comedy Central, Showtime and Epix. In 2001, he won “Best Male Stand-Up” at the American Comedy Awards. He has released eight comedy albums, including the 2007 Grammy Award-winning The Carnegie Hall Performance. He won his second Grammy Award for his album Stark Raving Black and has published three bestselling books: Nothing’s Sacred (Simon & Schuster, 2005), Me of Little Faith (Riverhead Books, 2008) and I’m Dreaming of a Black Christmas (Riverhead Books, 2010).

Born in the crazy atmosphere of South Florida, this 1st generation Cuban-American comedian has honed his craft into a freeing and inspired comedy experience. He is equally adept at traditional stand-up, improvisation, and his very own brand of original guitar comedy.

He has featured on CBS' ""Urban Latino"" and Telemundo's MUN2, show ""The Roof"". He frequently visits New York City- a mecca for all artists. Aside from garnering props from pros at Caroline's Comedy Club,Gotham, or Stand-up New York, Adrian also has proven to be quite electric in the ""alternative"" rooms sprinkled throughout the Village and the outer boroughs. He also explored the great west, immersed himself into the Denver comedy scene-where original fresh comedy flows as freely as the hand-crafted micro brews.  

Adrian has performed for Comedy Central's South Beach Comedy Festival, and was invited to Montreal's Just for Laugh's Comedy Festival where he was part of ""New Faces of 2010"" which spotlights up and coming comics from around the world.

Comedy Sex God Live: A Conversation with Pete Holmes and Nadia Bolz-Weber

PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT a stand-up show.

Every ticket includes a copy of Pete's new book: Comedy Sex God

Part autobiography, part philosophical inquiry, and part spiritual quest, Comedy Sex God is a hilarious, profound, and enlightening romp around the fertile mind of stand-up stand-out, podcast king, and HBO superstar Pete Holmes.

Pete Holmes is a comedian, writer, cartoonist, “Christ-leaning spiritual seeker”, and podcast host. His wildly popular podcast, You Made It Weird, is a comedic exploration of the meaning of life with guests ranging from Deepak Chopra and Elizabeth Gilbert to Seth Rogen and Garry Shandling. Pete also created and stars in the semi-autobiographical HBO show Crashing which he executive produces alongside Judd Apatow. An accomplished standup with three hour-long television specials and innumerable late night appearances, he continues to tour regularly to sold-out crowds.

Nadia Bolz-Weber, a former stand-up comic and author of two New York Times bestselling memoirs, will be moderating the conversation.

Roast Battle  (with Brian Moses)
From the Sunset Strip’s World Famous Comedy Store to three seasons on Comedy Central, the original Roast Battle insult competition has already spawned imitators the world over. Now for the first time ever, creator-host Brian Moses, DJ Coach Tea, and a colorful cast of LA’s top contenders are hitting the road to show local comics how it’s done, while treating audiences to the most outrageous, inclusive, and equalizing comedy they’ve ever experienced.

The rules are simple: “Nothing is off-limits except for physical contact. Original material only. And at the end of every battle, we hug.” The competitive-insult sensation dubbed “Fight Club for Comedians” is a demented, dirty, and decidedly adult live show that’s grown to an international phenomenon. 

Originally founded in 2013 to encourage warring comics to use their writing skills instead of their fists, today imitators dot the globe from Toronto to Tokyo and Barcelona to Bangkok. Along with spearheading festival runs at Just for Laughs Montreal, SXSW, and the New York Comedy Festival, creator and host Brian Moses has executive produced three seasons of Comedy Central’s Roast Battle television series with Roastmaster General Jeff Ross. International editions also film in Canada, Mexico, South Africa and the UK, where it became the most-viewed series in Comedy Central UK history.

AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.

His first taste of entertainment came at age eight when he tried his hand at magic with the help of a hypnosis book. As a young kid, Fator would practice talking without moving his lips. Little by little he began to create an eclectic cast of characters. Today, Fator impersonates more voices than he can count with the help of more than a dozen characters singing everything from Nat King Cole, Garth Brooks, Roy Orbison, Dean Martin, Elvis, Louis Armstrong, Bruno Mars and many more. 

Today, Fator finally has that audience of millions who enjoy his work through his sold-out and award-winning live show, multi-platinum selling DVDs (his debut DVD, ""Terry Fator: Las Vegas"" charted four times platinum), and numerous memorable television appearances. The industry has certified him a bona fide superstar, as well, with Simon Cowell declaring Fator to be ""one of the best entertainers in the world"" and The Best of Las Vegas Awards honoring ""Terry Fator: The VOICE of Entertainment"" with awards for Best Show, Best All-Around Performer, Best Impersonator and Best Overall Show.

AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.
AJ is an effective and engaging storyteller with a rhythm that quickly pulls you into his world. You'll laugh until you leave and then later you'll laugh again.

Uncalled Four hosted by Zac Maas
The most offensive comedy game show in America.

Half stand-up, half game show: Uncalled Four is an interactive crowd experience loosely based but in no way affiliated with the #1 card game in America. Comedians write a deck of 20 terrible/hilarious answers to audience questions like “What does Trump’s hair smell like?” or “Dad went out to buy _____ and never came back.”

Comedians each submit a card, audience members pick the winners and WIN prizes in each
round. In the final “Degenerate Gambler” round, comics wager points to see who will be
Denver's Worst Person! Uncalled Four has made appearances at festivals across the country.

Competing 6/24: Aaron Urist, Stephanie McHugh, Brandt Tobler, and Zach Reinert
August 19 is the Championship Game! After four rounds it is time for the Uncalled Four Championship game. Competing in this game are the winners of the last four games (Sam Tallent, Nathan Lund and two others TBD).  


ABOUT YOUR HOST ZAC MAAS:
Zac Maas hails from Denver, Colorado by way of South Dakota. He is a regular at Comedy
Works where he is a 4x New Faces Finalist. He has worked with many national touring acts
including Mike Birbiglia, Christopher Titus, Dana Gould, and Kyle Kinane. He has performed at Bridgetown, High Plains, Cape Fear, and Snub Fest comedy festivals.

AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.
AJ is an effective and engaging storyteller with a rhythm that quickly pulls you into his world. You'll laugh until you leave and then later you'll laugh again.

wellRED Comedy Tour
Comedy and writing partners Trae Crowder, Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester are ready to meet the people. You've seen Trae’s Liberal Redneck viral videos, you've read their weekly blog and now you'll see them at their best - performing stand up comedy.

Trae Crowder: @traecrowder
Recently earning national attention (or notoriety, depending on your viewpoint) for his ""Liberal Redneck"" series of viral videos, Trae Crowder has been performing his particular brand of Southern-fried intellectual comedy in the Southeast and beyond for the past six years. Trae is also a writer and is currently a member of NBC Universal's Talent Infusion Program.

Drew Morgan: @averagedrew
Hailing from rural East Tennessee, Drew draws on his experiences as a small-town son of a preacher man who has lived in Africa, Australia, Miami, Boston, and (currently) New York City. Weaving his stories together with observations on culture, religion, and identity, he's like Mark Twain on acid, or maybe just a confused Southerner pretending to have his shit together. He is a good dancer.

Corey Ryan Forrester (CoFo): @coreyfcomedy
Corey has been writing and performing stand up comedy since the age of sixteen - before he could legally work in a comedy club. His North Georgia roots have given Corey an affinity for Southern wit and storytelling. He may often wear a PBR hat, but don't assume there is anything blue collar about him. CoFo has thoughts on everything from race to religion, politics and gender. He loves women and cheese. All dairy, actually.

He has featured on CBS' ""Urban Latino"" and Telemundo's MUN2, show ""The Roof"". He frequently visits New York City- a mecca for all artists.
