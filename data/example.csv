AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.
AJ is an effective and engaging storyteller with a rhythm that quickly pulls you into his world. You'll laugh until you leave and then later you'll laugh again.

Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.

AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.

Background
More than 10,000 students drop out of Colorado schools every year. On average, a student who drops out is not eligible for 90% of available jobs and will cost taxpayers nearly $300,000 over their lifetime in lost tax revenue, crime, incarceration, and health related costs.

Since 2005, CYC has worked to reenroll youth who have dropped out of school and provide in-school programming to prevent youth from dropping out in the first place. We proudly serve 3,000 children and youth each year through early literacy support; high school intervention programs that target attendance and course failure; re-enrollment services for those that have dropped out; and a GED plus concurrent enrollment program in partnership with Aurora Public Schools.

Named one of the ""Top 100 Stand-Up Comedians of All Time"" by Comedy Central, Cross launched his “Making America Great Again!” tour in San Diego, CA and toured around the US. Cross took his tour to Europe for the first time ever, and also performed throughout Canada.

His new series, Bliss, is set to premier on Sky TV in the UK in February 2018.  The inventive series is about a travel writer who has two families, and neither knows of the others existence.  

IFC premiered the long-awaited third season of Todd Margaret, created by and starring Cross as an ill-equipped American who finds himself running the London sales office of the energy drink company for which he works. The original iteration, The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret, aired on IFC from 2010 to 2012. 

Cross reteamed with his Mr. Show collaborator and co-creator, Bob Odenkirk, to create Mr. Show with Bob and David, a four-episode revamp of the iconic sketch comedy series, which premiered November 2015 on Netflix. He also had a guest arc on the Netflix breakout comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as lawyer Russ Snyder, who finds himself in an unlikely relationship with fallen socialite Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski). 

On the big screen, Cross has appeared in the independent features, Kill Your Darlings and the dramedy It's a Disaster.  Other film credits include Abel, Year One, Christopher Guest’s Waiting for Guffman, Men in Black (I and II), Ghost World, Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pitch Perfect 2, I’m Not There, and provided his vocal talents for several animated films, including Megamind, the Kung Fu Panda franchise, and Curious George.

On television, Cross reprised his beloved role as Dr. Tobias Fünke' on the fourth season of Arrested Development on Netflix. During its original critically acclaimed, Emmy Award-winning run on FOX, Cross was twice-nominated as part of the ensemble cast for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Dean Delray
Dean Delray’s stand-up comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience.  His premises, punch lines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft-spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to loud volume animation.

Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on WTF with Marc Maron, Mohr Stories, You Made it Weird and his own weekly podcast, Let There Be Talk, on the All Things Comedy network.  Dean's Let There Be Talk podcast is full of raw, unfiltered, off-the-cuff conversations and deep insights with a diverse mix of engaging personalities from the worlds of music, film, TV, comedy and more.

Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hit maker for Gwen Stefani and Alicia Keys).

As an actor, Delray can be seen in The Longshots (starring Ice Cube), Hell Ride (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino), Maron on IFC, and most recently on the 3rd season of Netflix series Love (with Judd Apatow).  Dean's stand-up act is warm, inviting and subversively full of conviction, just like the man himself offstage.

Drew Lynch captured the hearts of America with his Golden Buzzer performance on Season 10 of America’s Got Talent.  Audiences across the country fell in love with his charming wit and genuine vulnerability.

At the young age of 19, Drew moved to Los Angeles with aspirations of becoming an actor.  A freak accident just a year into his acting career left Drew with a severe stutter, crushing his hopes of ever performing again.  His continued drive to become an entertainer forced him in a different direction. 

The reliability of Drew’s real-life situations in dealing with a stutter propelled him each week of the competition - advancing to the finals and ultimately earning 2nd place on season 10 of America's Got Talent.  Drew attributes much of his success from his ability to be honest- genuinely facing the “elephant in the room” head on.  He has made comedy his full time career, headlining comedy clubs all over the world.

Drew recently garnered a recurring role on IFC’s sitcom Maron, has appeared on Dr. Oz, and as a celebrity guest on the game show Idiot Test. Drew is collaborating on a book, and ultimately becoming the actor he always dreamed of, with a now different and enlightened perspective on who he thought he was, and who he is today.

His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids.

With forty-four Letterman appearances under his belt, more than any other comic, (not to mention a handful of Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Politically Incorrect gigs) Jake is no stranger to late night television. His late night appearances gave Jake the exposure he needed to land his very own HBO comedy special, This’ll Take About An Hour. Jake received incredible reviews, strong ratings, and a Cable Ace Award nomination for Best Writing in an Entertainment Special. People Magazine rated the special as one of the “ten best television shows of the year,” and TV Guide named it one of the “50 Funniest Moments of TV.”

Jake first worked with Rudolph on the film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, in which he co-starred in a cast that included Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell Scott.

Joe  Sib
Joe Sib, founder and co-conspirator of Side One Dummy Records for over twenty years, has continued to climb up the ranks of the comedy scene. Joe released his first comedy record, Joe Sib Nowhere Near the Top, in April 2017 which debuted #3 on the Billboard's Comedy Chart. From the 1980s punk scene to millennium parent, Joe’s comedy takes you on a manic, ride from growing up in the era of “safety last”, and into the present, as he tries to helicopter parent without a license.

After throwing himself into the punk and skate underground of his California hometown, Joe’s band Wax was signed to a major label as part of the early ’90s breakthrough of punk rock into the mainstream. He co-founded an indie label, SideOneDummy, that signed such now-iconic bands as Flogging Molly and The Gaslight Anthem. 


Turning his behind-the-music stories from the road into a one-man show led to touring as a stand-up comic, which led to such highlights as his recent tour with Metallica, in which he and  comedian Jim Breuer created a show that re-defined the term “opening act.” With every new twist and turn in his path, Joe has been left wondering “How did I get here?”

Lewis is the rare comic who can cause an audience to laugh themselves into incontinence while making compelling points about the absurdity of our world.

Lewis Black came into national prominence with his appearances on The Daily Show in 1996. Those appearances on The Daily Show led to comedy specials on HBO, Comedy Central, Showtime and Epix. In 2001, he won “Best Male Stand-Up” at the American Comedy Awards. He has released eight comedy albums, including the 2007 Grammy Award-winning The Carnegie Hall Performance. He won his second Grammy Award for his album Stark Raving Black and has published three bestselling books: Nothing’s Sacred (Simon & Schuster, 2005), Me of Little Faith (Riverhead Books, 2008) and I’m Dreaming of a Black Christmas (Riverhead Books, 2010).

WRY, WITTY, CUNNING, AND CRASS Detroit native Mike Stanley is all of these things, but none, when put on paper, quite manage to serve the justice dealt by Stanley onstage. Yeah, he's pretty hilarious, but more than just coarse anecdotes about life and sex, there's an enviable amount of heart and warmth behind Stanley's humor. 
 
Given his penchant toward brutal honesty, spiced up with a healthy dose of insatiable wit, it's not difficult to see why Stanley was named “Best Chicago Stand-up Comedian” in a Peoples Choice poll done by the Chicago Reader and “Best Detroit Comedian” by HOUR Magazine. Mike has appeared in The Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, The Adam Carolla Show and Funny or Die's Odd Ball Comedy Fest. Mike has had the pleasure of performing with many great comedians including Jerry Seinfeld, Robin Williams, Al Madrigal, Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr, Dave Attell, Doug Stanhope, Larry Miller, Andy Kindler, Artie Lange, Christopher Titus, and many more. 
 
Originally hailing from Motown, and after spending a decade honing his craft in the windy city of Chicago, Mike tours constantly, both domestically and internationally. Don't miss out on an incredible opportunity to catch the man in action - this high level of killer stand-up is too remarkable to sit out.

Roast Battle  (with Brian Moses)
From the Sunset Strip’s World Famous Comedy Store to three seasons on Comedy Central, the original Roast Battle insult competition has already spawned imitators the world over. Now for the first time ever, creator-host Brian Moses, DJ Coach Tea, and a colorful cast of LA’s top contenders are hitting the road to show local comics how it’s done, while treating audiences to the most outrageous, inclusive, and equalizing comedy they’ve ever experienced.

The rules are simple: “Nothing is off-limits except for physical contact. Original material only. And at the end of every battle, we hug.” The competitive-insult sensation dubbed “Fight Club for Comedians” is a demented, dirty, and decidedly adult live show that’s grown to an international phenomenon. 

Originally founded in 2013 to encourage warring comics to use their writing skills instead of their fists, today imitators dot the globe from Toronto to Tokyo and Barcelona to Bangkok. Along with spearheading festival runs at Just for Laughs Montreal, SXSW, and the New York Comedy Festival, creator and host Brian Moses has executive produced three seasons of Comedy Central’s Roast Battle television series with Roastmaster General Jeff Ross. International editions also film in Canada, Mexico, South Africa and the UK, where it became the most-viewed series in Comedy Central UK history.

Robert Dubac's  The Book of Moron
Robert Dubac’s newest Off-Broadway solo hit, The Book of Moron, has been described as one of the most “Hilarious” “Intelligent” and “Scorching” satirical attacks on idiocracy since Mark Twain. 

The Book of Moron is a fast-paced, hilarious production that combines satire and theater.  In The Book of Moron Dubac portrays, “Robert,” an everyman who has lost sight of the bigger picture.  He’s been bombarded by so much hype and spin he can’t remember who he is or what he believes.  Does he have a purpose?  Can he think for himself?  Is the truth in the details or in the pudding?  He hasn’t a clue.  He racks his brain searching for answers but finds nothing but voices.  

It’s all for one and one for all as Robert’s inner voices take him on a freight train of provocative thought to find the bigger picture and wake up from the coma of modern day life. 

Robert Dubac belongs to a unique breed of humorists, bringing to mind the best of Lily Tomlin and Mark Twain. He creates characters that boggle our minds with biting wit and rapid-fire satire while simultaneously crafting a simple story that binds us all together. His ability to combine the raucous laughter of stand-up comedy with the startling thrill of live theater continues to fill seats everywhere; as nothing like this can be seen on TV, that’s for sure. 

If you are yearning for some satire that cuts with a clever intelligent edge; if you are tired of adolescent comedies generated by the mediocrity of television; then buckle them up for a hilarious joy ride over the pot-holed highways of cultural hypocrisy with Robert Dubac’s The Book of Moron! 

It’s comedy on steroids. Think your funny bone can handle it?

Russell Peters
Working on New Material

Only a handful of today’s artists can claim their success began with YouTube, and even less, if any, having then been named alongside such luminaries as Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Eddie Murphy in Rolling Stone’s just released list of the 50 Best Comics of All Time. In comedian Russell Peters’ case, “success” may be a drastic understatement.

From a solidly working-class family, Peters learned the value of levity from his father and Russell’s own observations on the family’s struggles with racism and multicultural differences. In 2004, Peters gained critical and global recognition for his CTV Comedy Now! special which wound up on YouTube. That upload launched a new level of fame and unforeseen success. It also led to larger and larger shows, not only in arenas in his native Canada, where he became the first comedian to sell-out Toronto’s Air Canada Centre in 2007 (as of today, six times and over 100,000 people), but to arenas in the United States, the UK, Australia, South Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

Since that time Peters has released five stand-up specials on Showtime, Comedy Central and Netflix; Outsourced (2006); Red, White and Brown (2008); The Green Card Tour Live from the O2 Arena (2010); Notorious (2013); Almost Famous (2016) and a documentary series Russell Peters Vs The World (2013).

Peters has also appeared in CBS hit show Life in Pieces and has starred in several features; The Clapper, Public Schooled, Supercon, Ripped, The Jungle Book, Source Code, Breakaway, Girl In Progress as well as having lent his voice to Family Guy, Bojack Horseman, Bob’s Burgers  and Ribbit. He has also appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Jimmy Fallon Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Lopez Tonight, Craig Ferguson, The Queen Latifah Show and Def Comedy Jam.

Peters is currently filming and starring in his first series, The Indian Detective for CTV / Bell Media and Netflix, which will begin airing this Fall (2017).

In June 2017, Peters will begin a tour of clubs across the United States as he builds his new material.

She has also written for Jeff Ross and The Burn, as well as hosted the Roast of Justin Beiber Red Carpet and the CMA’s Red Carpet.

Originally from Calhoun, GA, Sarah Tiana's act emphasizes the thrills of growing up after “The War Of Northern Aggression” and trying to survive in the current battle of the sexes.  She doesn’t call herself “single” (she’s too old for that) she prefers to be called “sexually active.”

Sarah’s big break came after she was recognized for her ""breakout performance"" as Carmen in four episodes of Reno 911’s 7th season.  She helped create a sketch comedy company called The Strait Jacket Society, as a way to help young actors in Hollywood accelerate their stage time and gain exposure while still having fun (she has currently put over 500 actors through the program).

A downright ‘Merican, Sarah has done over 12 tours of comedy for the troops.  A trip to Iraq at the beginning of the war is highlighted in the documentary film, We Love You Mrs. Bevins.  She has also been a correspondent on The Soup Investigates and Love You, Mean It starring Whitney Cummings.  An avid sports fan, Sarah wrote for the ESPY Awards and the Rob Riggle NFL segments on FOX.

Comedian Shane Mauss has appeared on Conan, Jimmy Kimmel, Showtime, and has specials on both Comedy Central and Netflix, and interviews scientists for the podcast Here We Are.  He’s been a psychonaut for almost 20 years.  Psychedelics are the source of some of the most hilarious, thought-provoking, and well-received material of Shane’s career.  Now, he’s put together a one-of-a-kind show for the open-minded, insightful, inquisitive, curious weirdos among us.  

Unlike a typical stand-up act that is 45 minutes of set-up, punchline, repeat, this is an hour and a half show that is part stand-up, part funny stories of experiences, and part Ted Talk.  Shane will take us on a funny journey through the stigma, history, laws, and science of psychedelics.  He will share personal experiences and talk about the effects of hallucinogens like mushrooms, LSD, and DMT.  (Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar.)  This is not a bunch of dumb pot jokes.  This is some of the most thoughtful and unique humor you will ever see.  To answer your question, no!  Shane will not actually be on drugs during the actual performance, mostly because tripping at work is a waste of good drugs.  We’re all going to have a good trip.

In 2003, a small group of men from all walks of life got together and formed an adult hockey team in the Denver area. In the years that have followed, this one team has grown into nine.  And now, made up of over one hundred and fifty players, their families, and their friends, they have formed an entity called Dawg Nation Hockey Foundation. This is the region’s largest adult hockey organization with players ranging in age from 18 to 72.

Over the years, the Dawgs become so much more than just a hockey team. They became a family, celebrating good times and milestones together, and at the same time supporting each other during tragic times, such as devastating injuries, serious illnesses, and even the untimely death of one of their teammates.  In that spirit, they formed one of Denver’s fastest growing nonprofits.  This unique charity was founded with the sole purpose of helping adult hockey players from all over Colorado, who might require financial aid due to their own serious injuries or illnesses. Through various fundraising events, Dawg Nation strives to deliver assistance to those hockey playing brothers and sisters who need it most.

Steve-O 
Steve-O (a.k.a. Stephen Glover) has become a household name and it all started when he snatched a video camera from his father’s closet when he was fifteen years old.

Eventually, Steve-O’s videos made it into the hands of Jeff Tremaine (Jackass Creator, Director & Producer) who was working with Johnny Knoxville to create a stunt based reality show.  The rest is history.  MTV aired Jackass for three seasons.  Steve-O also launched his own “Steve-O Don’t Try This At Home Tour”, establishing himself as an accomplished stage performer, at venues throughout the U.S. and in a dozen countries. 

When the Jackass TV series ended, the team moved on to movies releasing Jackass: The Movie, and later Jackass: Number 2 as well as Jackass: 3D, all with Paramount films.  Steve-O and fellow Jackass alum, Chris Pontius, were given a spin-off show entitled Wildboyz, which aired on MTV and MTV2 and lasted four seasons.  Steve-O continued to thrill audiences with his outrageous stunts.  He competed on ABC’s hit show, Dancing With The Stars, and lasted six weeks, despite an injury and having virtually no dancing ability whatsoever. 

Steve-O has become a New York Times Bestselling Author with the release of his memoir, Professional Idiot, and has established himself as a force in the world of stand-up comedy.  Thus far (and still counting), his career as a performer has brought him to a total of 38 countries, and his first hour-long comedy special, Guilty As Charged, recently premiered on Showtime and performed in the top one percent of all Showtime comedy specials.

Terry Fator at Bellco Theatre
Presented by Zarlengo Foundation and Comedy Works Entertainment

Terry Fator is best known for winning Season 2 of NBC's hit competition show America's Got Talent. Fator's story began long before America's Got Talent. His first taste of entertainment came at age eight when he tried his hand at magic with the help of a hypnosis book. As a young kid, Fator would practice talking without moving his lips. Little by little he began to create an eclectic cast of characters. Today, Fator impersonates more voices than he can count with the help of more than a dozen characters singing everything from Nat King Cole, Garth Brooks, Roy Orbison, Dean Martin, Elvis, Louis Armstrong, Bruno Mars and many more. 

Today, Fator finally has that audience of millions who enjoy his work through his sold-out and award-winning live show, multi-platinum selling DVDs (his debut DVD, ""Terry Fator: Las Vegas"" charted four times platinum), and numerous memorable television appearances. The industry has certified him a bona fide superstar, as well, with Simon Cowell declaring Fator to be ""one of the best entertainers in the world"" and The Best of Las Vegas Awards honoring ""Terry Fator: The VOICE of Entertainment"" with awards for Best Show, Best All-Around Performer, Best Impersonator and Best Overall Show.

Proceeds will benefit The Zarlengo Foundation a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that supports schools and programs for learning disabled children in and around the Denver community.  A portion of the proceeds from the event will be used for scholarships, classroom resources, teacher training, and supporting the Zarlengo Foundation Learning Evaluation Center at Havern School. Since its inception, the foundation has contributed more than $941,000 to education-related causes in the Denver area.

Thick Skin
Comedy at its Rawest

Enjoy comedy the way it's intended. No holds barred, no punches pulled, and no f**ks given. Thick Skin is a show where amateur and national touring comedians compete for cash prizes to see who can be the funniest person in the room.  However, as much as “Good” comedy is rewarded ... “Bad” comedy is ridiculed by the show’s host Comedian Mike Stanley and a rotating cast of his comedian friends. 

Insightful, crass and just plain hilarious, Mike Stanley is a fifteen year comedy veteran. Stanley was named “Best Chicago Stand-up Comedian” in a Peoples Choice poll done by the Chicago Reader and “Best Detroit Comedian” by HOUR Magazine. Mike tours internationally and has performed at several festivals including the Oddball Comedy Festival, and TBS Just For Laughs Festival. 

Thick Skin features an improvised interactive game with the crowd to see who has the WORST tattoo in the audience. Give aways, prizes, contests. The show has been described as one big party.  

Hard R-rating. Thick Skin may not be for everybody, but everyone should see it!

Drawing audience members in with his deadpan self-deprecation and ability to pile punchline upon punchline, his decidedly low-key stage persona belies a deeply intelligent, often biting, occasionally absurdist worldview, one lauded by discerning fans who seek a fresh yet honest update to traditional observation and social commentary.

Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.

Twice a national finalist at the prestigious HBO Comedy Festival, Troy Baxley is already well-known in comedy circles. Baxley is the comic that other comics watch every chance they get. Even Letterman's talent scout Eddie Brill calls himself a “huge Troy Baxley fan.”

Others are catching on too. The Onion points out that ""only recently has [Baxley’s] weird brand of impish comedy started to penetrate the mainstream…” and from the way people turn out to see him every time he plays a gig, it appears to be true!

Baxley is more than a Comedian, he is also a Writer, a Voice Actor, and a Published Cartoonist. Not to mention, he has released three comedy albums, one comedy/music album titled ""Lifetime C Student"" and two stand-up comedy albums, ""Life Smarts"" and ""Nude.""

You simply have to see Baxley firsthand to get what is going on inside his insanely-funny mind. With his impeccable timing and sing song punchlines, there is never a dull moment in his show.

Comedy and writing partners Trae Crowder, Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester are ready to meet the people. You've seen Trae’s Liberal Redneck viral videos, you've read their weekly blog and now you'll see them at their best - performing stand up comedy.

Trae Crowder: @traecrowder
Recently earning national attention (or notoriety, depending on your viewpoint) for his ""Liberal Redneck"" series of viral videos, Trae Crowder has been performing his particular brand of Southern-fried intellectual comedy in the Southeast and beyond for the past six years. Trae is also a writer and is currently a member of NBC Universal's Talent Infusion Program.

Drew Morgan: @averagedrew
Hailing from rural East Tennessee, Drew draws on his experiences as a small-town son of a preacher man who has lived in Africa, Australia, Miami, Boston, and (currently) New York City. Weaving his stories together with observations on culture, religion, and identity, he's like Mark Twain on acid, or maybe just a confused Southerner pretending to have his shit together. He is a good dancer.

Corey Ryan Forrester (CoFo): @coreyfcomedy
Corey has been writing and performing stand up comedy since the age of sixteen - before he could legally work in a comedy club. His North Georgia roots have given Corey an affinity for Southern wit and storytelling. He may often wear a PBR hat, but don't assume there is anything blue collar about him. CoFo has thoughts on everything from race to religion, politics and gender. He loves women and cheese. All dairy, actually.

Born in the crazy atmosphere of South Florida, this 1st generation Cuban-American comedian has honed his craft into a freeing and inspired comedy experience. He is equally adept at traditional stand-up, improvisation, and his very own brand of original guitar comedy.

AJ Finney
Stylistically manic, artistically brilliant, AJ Finney is an eclectic Midwesterner with a passion for the psychedelic scene of the Sixties. Comedy, jam bands and Volkswagens — that’s him. 
He’s an eco-friendly, improvisational, sometimes philosophical, patchouli-soaked quipster. AJ’s organic approach is refreshing and his poetic stream of consciousness style makes for a colorful and unforgettable comedic experience. His audience (much like the Deadheads) are finding him through alternative venues such as music festivals, head shops, and record stores.  
AJ joined TJ Miller on his Meticulously Ridiculous tour in 2015. In 2014 AJ was crowned “Best of the Midwest” winner at Gilda’s LaughFest in Grand Rapids. He was also featured on the FOX television show Laughs, and was one of the 100 performers chosen for Season 8 of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. In 2013 he was a semifinalist in Comedy Central's Up Next.  He was a finalist in the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition. He was voted “Best in Fest” at the 2011 Detroit LaughFest and was a finalist in HBO’s Lucky 21 comedy competition.
AJ is an effective and engaging storyteller with a rhythm that quickly pulls you into his world. You'll laugh until you leave and then later you'll laugh again.
